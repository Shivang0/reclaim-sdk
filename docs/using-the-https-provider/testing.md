# Testing

Integration testing for the Reclaim Protocol using the HTTPS provider aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Verify End-to-End Functionality**: Test the entire flow of the Reclaim Protocol integration, from opening a website to generating proofs and submitting them to the callback URL. Verify that each step of the process works as expected.
2. **Ensure Correct Communication**: Validate that the mobile app and the Express.js backend server can communicate over the same network. This includes testing the link redirection to the Reclaim Wallet App and the successful transfer of proofs to the callback URL.
3. **Validate Proof Creation**: Ensure that the generated proofs accurately reflect the requested data from the website. Verify that the proofs contain the necessary information and conform to the expected structure and format.
4. **Confirm Callback URL Functionality**: Test the callback functionality by verifying that the submitted proofs are received correctly by the Express.js backend server. Validate that the proofs can be processed and utilized as intended in your application.

The integration testing scope should cover various scenarios, including positive and negative test cases, edge cases, and real-world use cases relevant to the functionality provided by the HTTPS provider. It is essential to thoroughly test different aspects of the integration to ensure the reliability and correctness of the Reclaim Protocol implementation.

## Integration Testing Environment Setup

To perform integration testing for the Reclaim Protocol using the HTTPS provider, you need to set up the following testing environment:

1. **Express.js Backend**: Ensure that your Express.js backend server is up and running. This server will handle the integration with the Reclaim Protocol and serve as the endpoint for receiving proofs.
2. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure that both your mobile phone and the server hosting the Express.js backend are connected to the same network. This allows seamless communication between the mobile app and the server during testing.
3. **Mobile Browser Access**: Make sure that the Express.js server is accessible from the mobile browser. You should be able to enter the server's IP address or hostname followed by the appropriate port in the mobile browser's address bar to access the server.
